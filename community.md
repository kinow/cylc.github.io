      * "Every week we have 300+ users who rely on Cylc. At any one time we
        typically have 700+ active workflows. Of the 11.7 million jobs run on our
        HPC systems in February 2020, 99.6% of them were submitted by Cylc."

Note this is not an exhaustive list.

Many of these centers use Cylc with [Rose](https://github.com/metomi/rose), a
framework for managing and running meteorological suites.

[NCAS Computational Modelling Services](https://www.ncas.ac.uk/en/cms) supports
the use of Rose and Cylc on the UK national HPC facility
[ARCHER](http://www.archer.ac.uk) and the [JASMIN](http://www.jasmin.ac.uk)
data center, for users throughout the UK academic community.

[ARC Computational Modelling Systems](http://climate-cms.unsw.wikispaces.net/)
supports use of Rose and Cylc with the Unified Model in the Australian academic
community.
